# binary_heap_sample

* Complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as possible).  
* Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap.  
* In Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap.  
* The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree.  
* Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.
